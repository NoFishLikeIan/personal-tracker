# Personal Tracker 📹

This is a tracker that should provide easy record of my personal life metrics via http. I built it in the fastest and simplest way possible so I need to thank the people that made [python-lenses](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/181037/systeme-package) and [mongodb]() because they speeded up my workflow drastically.

Also please, feel free to make it yours and PR or whatever you want!

### Future...
- 🐳 Dockerizing everything!
- 📈 The idea is to add analytics and data analysis on the gathered data but it will only happen once enough data is collected!
